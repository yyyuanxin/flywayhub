# This workflow uses Flyway Hub to test the Flyway database migrations in the 'sql' path(s).
#
# The workflow will run automatically against all pull requests that modify files under 'sql'.
#
# It will also run on all pushes to 'main' that modify files under 'sql'.
#
# In order to use this workflow you will need to create a Github Actions secret called
# FLYWAY_HUB_ACCESS_TOKEN containing a valid Flyway Hub API access token.
